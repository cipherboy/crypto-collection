 * rc2 rc2_init
 *
 * Initializes the rc2 structure by generating subkeys from the master key.
 *
 * Key expansion
 *
 * Since we will be dealing with eight-bit byte operations as well as
 * 16-bit word operations, we will use two alternative notations
 * for referring to the key buffer:
 *
 *     For word operations, we will refer to the positions of the
 *     buffer as K[0], ..., K[63]; each K[i] is a 16-bit word.
 *
 *     For byte operations, we will refer to the key buffer as
 *     L[0], ..., L[127]; each L[i] is an eight-bit byte.
 *
 * These are alternative views of the same data buffer. At all times it
 * will be true that:
 *     K[i] = L[2*i] + 256*L[2*i+1].
 * (Note that the low-order byte of each K word is given before the
 * high-order byte.)
 *
 * We will assume that exactly T bytes of key are supplied, for some T
 * in the range 1 <= T <= 128. (Our current implementation uses T = 8.)
 * However, regardless of T, the algorithm has a maximum effective key
 * length in bits, denoted T1. That is, the search space is 2^(8*T), or
 * 2^T1, whichever is smaller.
 *
 * The purpose of the key-expansion algorithm is to modify the key
 * buffer so that each bit of the expanded key depends in a complicated
 * way on every bit of the supplied input key.
 *
 * The key expansion algorithm begins by placing the supplied T-byte key
 * into bytes L[0], ..., L[T-1] of the key buffer.
 *
 * The key expansion algorithm then computes the effective key length in
 * bytes T8 and a mask TM based on the effective key length in bits T1.
 * It uses the following operations:
 *
 *     T8 = (T1+7)/8;
 *     TM = 255 MOD 2^(8 + T1 - 8*T8);
 *
 * Thus TM has its 8 - (8*T8 - T1) least significant bits set.
 *
 * For example, with an effective key length of 64 bits, T1 = 64, T8 = 8
 * and TM = 0xff. With an effective key length of 63 bits, T1 = 63, T8
 * = 8 and TM = 0x7f.
 *
 * The key expansion operation consists of the following two loops and
 * intermediate step:
 *
 *     for i = T, T+1, ..., 127 do
 *         L[i] = PITABLE[L[i-1] + L[i-T]];
 *     L[128-T8] = PITABLE[L[128-T8] & TM];
 *     for i = 127-T8, ..., 0 do
 *         L[i] = PITABLE[L[i+1] XOR L[i+T8]];
 *
 * (In the first loop, the addition of L[i-1] and L[i-T] is performed
 * modulo 256.)
 *
 * The "effective key" consists of the values L[128-T8],..., L[127].
 * The intermediate stepâ€™s bitwise "and" operation reduces the search
 * space for L[128-T8] so that the effective number of key bits is T1.
 *
 * The expanded key depends only on the effective key bits, regardless
 * of the supplied key K. Since the expanded key is not itself modified
 * during encryption or decryption, as a pragmatic matter one can expand
 * the key just once when encrypting or decrypting a large block of data.
